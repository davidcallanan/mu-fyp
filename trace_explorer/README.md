# Trace Explorer

This useful web tool allows for debugging parser traces generated by the frontend, and outputted to `frontend.trace.json` file. So if something does not parse correctly, it can be tackled using this tool, to see where it went wrong.

This webapp uses my SolidStart template as detailed below, which I use in all my web applications.

The template can be found [here](https://github.com/davidcallanan/solidstart-template).

## Minimal SolidStart Template

Get started with this SolidStart template:

```
npx degit davidcallanan/solidstart-template app
```

Run `pnpm i` and `pnpm dev` to start the development server.

Included in this stack is:

 - Tailwind
 - Tanstack Router
 - TRPC
