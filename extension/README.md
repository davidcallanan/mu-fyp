# Extension

This directory houses the VS Code extension for my language, which provides syntax highlighting to the programmer.

It is unlikely that any additional extension features would be worked on, as that would be out of the scope of this project.

## Setup

- Ensure `vsce` command is set up on your system.

## Build

- `vsce package`

## Install

- Within VS Code, right click the generated `.vsix` file in the explorer tree.
- Select "Install Extension VSIX".
- You may need to reload your window to see the changes take effect.

## Structure

- The `language-configuration.json` file contains some fundamental syntax rules that VS Code needs to know about.
- The `syntaxes/essencec.tmLanguage.json` file contains the meat up the syntax and also assigns appropriate colors to the syntax.

## Autogenerated Files

The `yo code` command was used to generate the boilerplate for this directory.

Thus, some files were auto-generated by the CLI.

Some other files were scaffolded by the CLI but have since been modified significantly.
